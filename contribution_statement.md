Isaac: 
Initial Code with Random Forest Analysis. Writing scripts for main.ipynb. Made Jupyterbook/guthub site as well as github action

Brandon: 
I added some extra code with the random forest analysis, including the one hot encoding and label encoding functions. I added those functions to another folder, and I created additional tests for them. I also created empty folders to contain all our figures and data. I made sure that our code could run properly and saved the figures in the right spots. I also created the environment.yml for our project. I also made sure that our tools package was installable. The final thing that I did was create the majority of the Makefile.

Raj: 
I focused a lot more on the clean-up aspects of this project. I wrote out the plotting function for all our plots above in order to add that into the package, and not have it here on our final doc. Additionally, I cleaned up and wrote out some of the text above in order to make the story flow throughout, and make it an easier read overall. Finally, I added our license to our GitHub and a README to the doc.
