### Abstract:
In this report, we looked to finding the most important features when looking at house price. The data used in our analysis was a public data set of houses selling in Ames, Iowa, with many features detailing everything from the square footage of the house to the utilities included in the house. Of all these features, we sought to find which features were the most important via a Random Forest model, and to also see simply if we can even predict housing prices based on the knowledge of just a couple features. Through our analysis, and with a resulting 0.87 resulting adjusted R^2 value, we found these key features and we hope they can be of help to people in the future. This was made public so that (a) Binder can find it and (b) in order to help both sides of the negotiation table - the sellers and the buyers in understanding which features most rack up typical prices.

### Startup: 
Via clicking the Binderlink and/or access to the environment.yml file along with the data, you should have access to the same starting point and installations as us when it comes to analysis. If you'd like to run all the analysis and see all the code together, refer to ohc.ipynb or lc.ipynb and simply run the code! In order to test, refer to the tests in the tool packaging in order to make sure the encoding and the plotting is working as it should. If all of these check out, you are good to go!

This repository is a homework assignment that analyzes housing prices and outputs the features homebuyers are most interested in, as a homework assignment for the Spring 2022 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science.
